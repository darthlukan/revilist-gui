## Description

> ReviList provides a new way for Document Controllers, LCI Coordinators, and Project Managers to manage documents on
> projects, Revilist-GUI is the client-side application consuming the ReviList API that allows all of the magic to
> happen.  The concept is simple: Give Document Controllers and LCI Coordinators a tool that lets them track their
> documents and projects without having to resort to expensive solutions that do nothing to assist them in their work
> or worse, push them to using spreadsheets (Yuck!).

> The founding concepts of Revilist come from the mind of [@kstavenes](https://github.com/kstavenes), a Document Lead in the Norwegian Oil&Gas industry
> who has for years been plagued by the failures of supposed "Document Control Software" that failed to let her to
> perform the primary task: Track documents. It is her expertise and knowledge of the industry that is behind ReviList
> and all credit for the ideas behind the application belong to her.
